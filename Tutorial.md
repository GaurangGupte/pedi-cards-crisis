# Introduction

Welcome to the project!

To facilitate multiple people working on it, we are utilizing two common tools in software development: Git and GitHub. 

**Git** is a software version control program. It was developed by Linus Torvalds (yes, the creator of Linux!) to manage the development of Linux across the multi-continental Linux team composed of thousands of members. Its success is seen today in that Linux powers mission-critical applications such spacecraft and servers.  

**GitHub** is an online database that stores our software versions. Git syncs our code with GitHub. 

# Using Git + GitHub

This is an excellent brief video on Git [What is Git? Explained in 2 Minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ReR1YJrNOM)

First, you need to install Git if you don't have it already. 

* Windows: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
* Mac: Already installed by default
* Linux: Already installed by default

Next, follow this tutorial. I encourage you to work along with his examples and take notes in a separate Word document as you listen to him: [Git Tutorial For Dummies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-qvsxPHpY)

Once you have gained familiarity with it, incorporate Git into your Microsoft Visual Studio installation. Please read this instruction set: [VS Code Git integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git)
